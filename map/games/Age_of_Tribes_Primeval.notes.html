<br><b><span style="font-size:14px;color:0C0C0C;">General Information:</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">This is pure counterfactual history. In this timeline, the ancient tribes of Europe banded together in two large opposing alliances a long time ago. Since that time their sole purpose was to destroy the other civilization and prove their own cultural and military supremacy. But who would be the triumphing part? The Eastern Tribes or the Western Tribes?</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">This map includes a tech system with a tech tree. Players can purchase technological developments, place them at bases, thereby gaining access to new and better units, while at the same time automatically outdating old ones.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">The map has a VERY LONG PLAYTIME, approximately 25-100 rounds. The tech tree can be fully developed by round 85. Because of these conditions, players can choose to jump into the tribal war at other time periods than the primeval age. This can be done by playing the different available versions of Age of Tribes.</span><br>

<br>
<center><img src="Line4.png"/></center>
<br><b><span style="font-size:14px;color:0C0C0C;">Buildings:</span></b><br>
<br><center><img src="Command-Bunker.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Bases</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Players can develop bigger and more productive bases throughout the game. Old and obsolete base types are sometimes torn down. The Camp is the first base type. The Fort is the second base type. When the third base type is developed, the Castle, all camps are removed from the map. When the forth base type is developed, the Citadel, all Forts are removed, and so forth. This means that a player can only have and use the two latest base types. Missile Shields and Energy Shields also outdate any base type older than the Command Bunker. All bases can be bombarded, thereby getting damaged or destroyed. If a base is damaged, its production capacity is reduced.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Missile-Shield.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Missile Shields</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">These are the strongest anti-air unit available. Each building will fire at up to five enemy aircraft in every battle round. Each aircraft will have a 42% risk of getting hit. Only Stealth Bombers can lower this risk to 33%. These shields also fire during Strategic Bombardment attacks.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Energy-Shield.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Energy Shields</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">These powerful defensive buildings have the ability to protect defending units by lowering the attack power of attacking enemies. A total of five enemy units are given -1 on their attack dice. The shield has no effect against Strategic Bombardment.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Bomber.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Bombardment</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Bases and other buildings can be strategic bombarded by special units and thereby damaged or destroyed. Base types have different amounts of hit points, but all base damage can be repaired at the beginning of the owning players purchase phase. Damaged bases have their unit building and placement capabilities reduced.</span><br>
<br>
<center><img src="Line5.png"/></center>
<br><b><span style="font-size:14px;color:0C0C0C;">Special Units:</span></b><br>
<br><center><img src="Observation-Balloon.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Observation Balloons</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">These balloons assist artillery units in spotting enemies from afar. Afterward, they help guide artillery attacks against them. A total of up to three friendly artillery units may in this manner receive a +2 on their attack or defense dice.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Submarine.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Submarines</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Submarines are special naval units of the late ages. They have the special ability to perform instant killing first strikes, to submerge before or after battle start, and finally to move unnoticed into enemy waters during the non combat move phase. Submarines can also prevent enemy Submarines from submerging out of battle.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Mortar.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Mortars</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">These units are specialized in devastating enemy bases from a distance. They fire volleys of exploding iron ordinance towards enemy buildings. Though specialized against buildings, the mortar can also attack other military units within range.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Rocket-Launcher.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Rocket Launchers</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">These mobile units are in the top line of advanced military hardware. Rocket Launchers may fire large and destructive Rockets every round. These Rockets may be aimed at either enemy units or enemy buildings. Be aware that Submarines attacked by Rockets can just submerge out of danger.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Truck.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Trucks</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Trucks are capable of transporting footmen and support footmen. One Truck can move one footman two territories. To move Trucks and footmen two territories, click and mark the Trucks, click and mark an equal number of footmen and then click on the targeted territory two moves away. All Trucks and footmen will now move directly into that territory. Trucks can also blitz through and capture enemy territories during this operation.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Air-Transport.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Air Transports</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">These planes can carry up to three Infantry, Shock Troopers or War Robots into battle. After paradrops, these Air Transports also participate in any following battle. If they survive, then they may/must fly back to a friendly territory. Be aware that Anti-Air Units might shoot down Air Transports before paradrops can occur.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Stealth-BomberNew.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Stealth Bombers</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">These aircraft use advanced technology that makes them hard to detect and hit. Each Stealth Bomber therefore causes three enemy units to fight with a -1 on their attack or defense dice.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Attack-Drone.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Robots and Drones</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">War Robots and Attack Drones are deadly killing machines of the future. They have the special advantage of being immune to the deadly radiation effects of nuclear weapons and the hampering conditions of Radiation Zones.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Barrage-Balloon.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Barrage Balloons</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">These balloons are the first form of anti-air weapons available. For every Barrage-Balloon present during battle rounds, one aircraft, except bombers and paradropping air transports, has a 25% risk of colliding with balloon cables. The units are relative cheap and the crews will also fight against any enemy ground forces they encounter.</span><br>
<br><center><img src="Anti-Air.png"/></center>
<b><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Anti-Air Units</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">This weapon system may fire at every type of enemy aircraft it encounters. For every Anti-Air unit present during battle rounds, one aircraft has a 33.33% risk of getting shot down. Furthermore, the Anti-Air crews will fight against any enemy ground forces they encounter as well as attack any enemy aircraft flying over them.</span><br>
<br>
<center><img src="Line6.png"/></center>
<br><b><span style="font-size:14px;color:0C0C0C;">Nukes:</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">Nuke units and Nuclear Ballistic Missiles are both specialized and destructive units. The following applies to both delivery systems:</span>
<ul>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;"><li>A nuke attack has a 50% kill chance on 5 enemy units.</li></span>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;"><li>A nuke attack will create a radiation zone.</li></span>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;"><li>A radiation zone will affect up to 100 defending enemy units with a -1 on any defense roll.</li></span>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;"><li>A radiation zone will cost the holder of the territory 1 PU income every round.</li></span>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;"><li>Radiation zones may stack, thereby costing the defender even more PUs.</li></span>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;"><li>Radiation zones are permanent, but War Robots and Attack Drones are immune to any and all nuke strikes and radiation.</li></span>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;"><li>Radiation zones prevent attackers from blitzing.</li></span>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;"><li>It is possible to attack with a nuke alongside other forces, but then the nuke will only blow if the attack fails.</li></span>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;"><li>If the attack succeeds, the nuke will not blow. Nuke bombers may in this case fly back to friendly territory.</li></span>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;"><li>International nuclear regulations prevent tribes from possessing more than one nuke plane at a time.</li></span>
</ul>
<br><center><img src="Nuke.png"/></center>
<br><b><span style="font-size:14px;color:0C0C0C;">Nuclear Missile Silos:</span></b>
<br><span style="font-size:12px;color:0C0C0C;">International nuclear regulations prevent all tribal nations from building more than one missile silo. However, a silo will always restock and acquire a new missile after a missile is launched. Moreover, it is still possible to capture and use enemy silos without attracting international attention and risking intervention.</span><br>
