It changed the conditions of war. Footmen became heavier, horsemen<br>became steel-plated, and even siege weapons began shooting further. However, the<br>effectiveness of enemy weaponry was not the only concern of the tribes. Rumors had<br>it that an all destructive plague was ravaging Asia, and this plague, this Black Death,<br>was about to hit Europe.<br><br>Age gives +20 Tech and +20 PUs per turn, besides territory income.<br>The Black Death is set to arrive in the end of round 26.<br>Use military units to contain and eradicate the plague.<br>All Axemen and Mammoths are now outdated.</body>

The technological advances<br>in industry and science were to revolutionize warfare. It became possible to mass-<br>produce weapons with enhanced range, accuracy and lethality.

Note81=<body><center><img src="Alarm.png"/></center><h2>The Cold War turns warm!</h2>The Cold War only lasted a couple of decades. Some historical archives<br>indicate that the Eastern Tribes were just about to conduct a preemptive<br>first strike on the West, and that this attack plan was discovered by<br>Western spies in the East. Other archives show that it was the Western<br>Tribes themselves who fabricated and planted these plans in the East,<br>afterwards using the alleged imminent attack as an excuse to strike<br>first themselves.

Constant strife and<br>military conflict had nearly perfected the effectiveness of war machines and<br>weaponry, or more correctly speaking, perfected it to the highest level possible taking<br>in mind the limited resources available. When the cold war turned warm, the peace<br>was replaced by a new and all decisive war, the Great Tribal War.
